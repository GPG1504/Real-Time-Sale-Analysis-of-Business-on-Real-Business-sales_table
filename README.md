# Sales_DataAnalysis-on-Real-Business-sales_table

## Project Overview

Foundational SQL Project: Retail Sales Data-to-Insight Workflow. This initiative equips aspiring data analysts with the essential skills needed for the job market. You will master the full data lifecycle: designing a retail sales database, performing crucial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and using advanced SQL to solve real-world business challenges. The perfect hands-on experience to build a solid, demonstrable portfolio foundation.

## Objectives:

1. **Set up a retail sales database**: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
4. **Business Analysis**: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.

## Project Structure:

### 1. Database Setup

- **Database Creation**: The project starts by creating a database named `AProject`.
- **Table Creation**: A table named retail_sales is created to store the sales data. The table structure includes columns for transaction ID, sale date, sale time, customer ID, gender, age, product category, quantity sold, price per unit, cost of goods sold, and total sale amount.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE ss_project;

CREATE TABLE sales_sum
AS
(SELECT order_date,customer_name,voucher_no, GSTIN, Gross_Total from ss_Sales 
order by 1);
```

### 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning

- **Record Count**: Determine the total number of records in the dataset.
- **Customer Count**: Find out how many unique customers are in the dataset.
- **Category Count**: Identify all unique product categories in the dataset.
- **Null Value Check**: Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.

## Project Scope: Customer Sales Revenue Analysis:

This project demonstrates foundational SQL skills by analyzing a simplified real-world sales ledger, focusing on vendor transactions. Using only the columns order_date, customer_name, voucher_no, GSTIN, and Gross_Total, the project showcases essential database management and querying techniques. The goal is to perform data manipulation and extract core revenue metrics per customer/vendor. It is an ideal starting point for beginners to master basic SQL aggregation and data structuring.

### 3. Data Analysis & Findings

The following SQL queries were developed to answer specific business questions related to revenue, customer value, and temporal trends:

1.  **View Complete Sales Data:** Write a SQL query to display all records from the ss_sales table, showing the raw unprocessed sales data.
2.  **Standardize Column Names:** Write SQL commands to rename inconsistent or unclear column headers into clean, standardized column names like order_date, voucher_no, gross_total, and GSTIN.
3.  **Create a Summary Table** Write a SQL query to generate a new table (sales_sum) containing essential sales fields (order_date, customer_name, voucher_no, GSTIN, gross_total) for easier reporting and analysis
4.  **Compute Customer-Wise Total Revenue** Write a SQL query to calculate the total Gross_Total value contributed by each customer_name, showing how much revenue each customer generated.
5.  **Calculate Overall Grand Total Sales:** Write a SQL query to compute the sum of all Gross_Total values across the entire sales dataset, providing the total revenue generated by the business.

## Key Insights & Discoveries
**Top Customer/Vendor Performance: The analysis successfully determined the total revenue contributed by each customer (customer_name), providing a clear ranking of the highest-value accounts.**
**Overall Financial Snapshot: The calculation of the Grand Total Revenue offers a quick, summarized view of the entire business's sales performance during the recorded period.**
**Transaction Tracking: The use of voucher_no and GSTIN provides the necessary structure for tracking individual transactions and for future regulatory reporting or auditing.**

## Conclusion

This project provides a clear and practical demonstration of essential SQL aggregation and data management techniques crucial for financial reporting. By structuring and querying the core sales ledger data, we were able to quickly determine overall revenue and identify top-performing customers. The skills utilized—including data type modification, table creation from a select statement, and grouped aggregation (SUM/GROUP BY)— form a solid, foundational skill set for any beginner in data analysis.
